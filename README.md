# Computer Science Class Submissions
## Overview

These programs were created by me as homework assignments in my Introduction to Computer Science class. Before this class, I had almost no experience with programming. However, this class taught me so much and helped me gain confidence in coding. I learned how to implement functions, classes, looping, and many other common python practices. 

## Software Used
- Python
- IDLE

## Assignments
- Iterated Prisoners Dilemma
- Word Tools
- Simple Ciphers

### Iterated Prisoners Dilemma
Implementing a tournament for iterated prisoner's dilemma game, famous in the field of game theory. This program contains six different classes that each hold a different strategy on how to win the game of iterated prisoner's dilemma.
### Word Tools
A program that plays around with words learned into the computer. The computer learns a file of valid words and can unlearn words too. New words can be discovered with insertions, deletions, replacements, and anagrams. A ladder of a word can also be explored by starting with a given word and ending with a given word through iterations of changing the beginning word into the ending word.
### Simple Ciphers
This program can cipher or decipher files using ROT letter substitution. A file is read in and loops through the characters, whichever word matches closest with a word in the dictionary, the program will accept that word and print it.
